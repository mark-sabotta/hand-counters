This repository is for using Javascript to count Poker Hands. Cards are indexed from 0 to 51, with 0 being
the Ace of Spades and 51 being the King of hearts. I wrote this to give myself more options when writing combinatorics problems
for my Pre-Calculus students. The program is used to verify the solution to the question "How many straights and full houses 
contain the ace of spades?" The program only serves this purpose, but it could be adapted to fit similar questions.
